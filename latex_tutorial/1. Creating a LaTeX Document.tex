(1) Starting LaTeX document

Any LaTeX document starts with above "documentclass". Users insert font size and type of the document in the square bracket and curly bracket respectively.

There are various types of layouts user can create through LaTeX. When using Texmaker, one can immediately browse auto-completed list that gives series of possible layout objects. Just type "begin" as above to browse the list, and the chunk of that object will be automatically made.

(2) Math mode

In-line math mode starts and ends with single dollar sign. For example, $\hat{\beta}_{OLS}=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y$ integrates expression for OLS estimator in current paragraph.

Display math mode start and ends with double dollar sign. For example, $$\hat{\beta}_{OLS}=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y$$ will create a separate line for expression for OLS estimator.

(3) Changing line

Hard return creates new paragraph. For this, simply press Return key(or Enter key) twice.

Soft return changes line in current paragraph. For this, enter backslashes twice like this: \\
